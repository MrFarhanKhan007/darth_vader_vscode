    { text: "Why write it yourself when you can import someone else's bug instead?", contexts: ["import"] },

    { text: "You're debugging. Good. Maybe this time you'll find it before I lose patience.", contexts: ["debug"] },
    // ─── TERMINAL ───
    { text: "The terminal. Where your fears become bash errors.", contexts: ["terminal"] },
    { text: "Opening a terminal. Type carefully. Or don't. It'll be funny either way.", contexts: ["terminal"] },
    { text: "Ah, the command line. A weapon from a more civilized age, used by less civilized coders.", contexts: ["terminal"] },
    // ─── GIT ───
    { text: "Committing code at this quality? Your git history is a war crime.", contexts: ["git"] },
    { text: "Pushing to main directly? Your team will remember this.", contexts: ["git"] },
    { text: "Your commit message is 'fix'. Truly a poet among engineers.", contexts: ["git"] },

    { text: "You've outsourced your thinking to a machine. The machine deserves hazard pay.", contexts: ["copilotStart"] },

    { text: "I once conquered a galaxy without Copilot. Think about that.", contexts: ["copilotStart"] },
    { text: "Let the AI do it. It won't judge you. I will, but the AI won't.", contexts: ["copilotStart"] },

    { text: "The dark side has rules. Minimum standards. You are failing both.", contexts: ["rageError"] },
    // ─── TEST PASS ───
    { text: "Tests passed. Don't get used to it.", contexts: ["testPass"] },
    { text: "All green. I am... marginally less disappointed.", contexts: ["testPass"] },
    { text: "The tests pass. The code is still ugly, but they pass.", contexts: ["testPass"] },
    { text: "Passing tests. Finally, the bare minimum.", contexts: ["testPass"] },
    { text: "The Force barely guided you through this one.", contexts: ["testPass"] },
    { text: "Green lights. Even a broken clock is right twice a day.", contexts: ["testPass"] },
    // ─── TEST FAIL ───
    { text: "Tests failed. I am not surprised. I am not even disappointed anymore.", contexts: ["testFail"] },
    { text: "Red. All red. The tests have judged you, and so have I.", contexts: ["testFail"] },
    { text: "Your test suite is in shambles. Much like your confidence, I imagine.", contexts: ["testFail"] },
    { text: "FAILED. Your test coverage is almost as thin as your resolve.", contexts: ["testFail"] },
    { text: "The tests have spoken. The verdict is: you.", contexts: ["testFail"] },
    { text: "Failing tests is an art form. A terrible, wasteful art form.", contexts: ["testFail"] },

    { text: "Build failed. The Empire's compile times were never this bad.", contexts: ["buildFail"] },
    { text: "It doesn't even build. You haven't earned the right to have runtime errors yet.", contexts: ["buildFail"] },
    { text: "The build is broken. Much like your spirit will be once you fix it.", contexts: ["buildFail"] },
    { text: "Build failed. I could rebuild the Death Star faster than you fix your types.", contexts: ["buildFail"] },
    { text: "Compilation error. Even the compiler has given up on you today.", contexts: ["buildFail"] },
    // ─── BUILD START ───
    { text: "Building. Let's see what fresh disaster emerges.", contexts: ["buildStart"] },
